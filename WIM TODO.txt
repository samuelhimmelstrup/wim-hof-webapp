- NEED TO

- QUILLUM for rich text editor

- UUID for sessions

- Move all sound to BreathingSession
    - maybe not necessary
- Field for silentHold

IMPORTANT
- Stop music when session ends
- And stop music when you go back from session

- Add to favorite doesnt fucking work
    - doesnt fucking update

- DELETE MY USER AND REMAKE IT (favArray off)
    - maybe just delete array items (ArrayRemove)

- More laidback breathing sounds

- Make pause button as component


- NICE TO

- combine stage '3count' with rest (have still BreathBubble when 3 count shows)
- Remove outermost border on SessionItem (where it shows holds)
- Make it possible to move rounds in dynamic form (how do I change round?)
- Fix error "cannot update comp while rendering another"
- Field for title in form if user chooses to save

- SVG for silentHold
- A volume button for controlling music and breaths
- Accessbility, especially in form
- Host mp3s on firebase and fetch them
