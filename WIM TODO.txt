- NEED TO

- Move all sound to BreathingSession
    - maybe not necessary
- Field for silentHold

- DELETE MY USER AND REMAKE IT (favArray off)
    - maybe just delete array items (ArrayRemove)

- Remove Round field from sessionData objects (infer from index)?
    - BreathingSession uses round, change that

- Go back to homepage on SignOut (do it in SignOut button function)

- Make it possible to go back to frontpage while in session

- More laidback breathing sounds

- Fix error "cannot update comp while rendering another"


- NICE TO

- Make it possible to move rounds in dynamic form (how do I change round?)
- Back button som komponent over det hele
- Field for title in form if user chooses to save

- SVG for silentHold
- A volume button for controlling music and breaths
- Accessbility, especially in form
- Host mp3s on firebase and fetch them
